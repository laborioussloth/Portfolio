# About

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

Hello, I am currently a 4th year student majoring in Business Data Analytics. With a passion for data analysis and a desire to develop a career in this field, I am looking for work opportunities to apply the knowledge I have learned and hone more practical skills. Using my knowledge of Python, SQL, R, Excel, and Power BI, I conducted several data analysis projects to demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data.

This is my repository to showcase skills, share project  and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics

# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## **Clean and analyze FIFA data**

**Code:** 

**Description**: The project includes loading data, cleaning and processing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between transfer value (Value) and POT factors, OVA, Wage, Age. Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Skill:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization

**Technology:** Python

**Result:** Determine factors affecting transfer value such as age, Overall, POT


## **Analyze bicycle sales data**

**Code:**

**Goal:** Find insights from past sales data to evaluate performance

**Description:** The project includes cleaning and pre-processing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing and designing dashboards on Power BI to provide useful information and identify factors affect revenue. 

**Skill:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Power BI

**Result:** Designed dashboard showing revenue affected by factors, revenue trends, moving average of revenue

## **Machine learning application to predict robusta coffee prices**

**Code:** 

**Goal:** Forecast the trend of coffee prices based on weather factors, exchange rates, and oil prices

**Description:** The dataset is collected from many different sources, including: weather information in Gia Lai, oil prices, USD/VND exchange rate, robusta coffee price. The project focuses on collecting, cleaning, standardizing data and applying machine learning algorithms to price forecasting. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning

**Technology:** Python, machine learning

**Result:** Weather factors, oil prices, and exchange rates affect robusta coffee prices. Built Random Forest, LSTM, SVR machine learning models to predict future price and coffee trends.

## **ARIMA/SARIMA model in stock price forecasting**

**Code:**

**Goal:** Forecast stock prices of companies in the construction industry from price data in the last 5 years

**Description:** The data set is collected from the stock exchange, including stock prices of 5 companies in the construction industry group: HT1, HBC, ACC, VCG, CVT in the most recent year. The project focuses on applying the ARIMA and SARIMA time series data models to price forecasting.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, time series prediction

**Technology:** python, tableu

**Result:** Successfully built the ARIMA model to forecast future stock price trends.

## **Vehicle clustering and routing using the K-Means algorithm**

**Code:**

**Goal**: Build a route for vehicles

**Description:** Cargo trucks move one by one from a single warehouse to pickup points and back. Each vehicle has a specified maximum capacity and all vehicles have equal capacities. Vehicles only pass through each pick-up point once. The collected data set includes the location of pickup points and vehicle capacity. The project focuses on applying the K-Means algorithm and the greedy algorithm to build a route for each vehicle so that the number of vehicles is minimum and the distance traveled is minimum while still ensuring vehicle capacity.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning

**Technology:** Python

**Result:** Cluster customer points and determine paths within each cluster
