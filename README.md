Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!
Hello, I am currently a 4th year student majoring in Business Data Analytics. With a passion for data analysis and a desire to develop a career in this field, I am looking for work opportunities to apply the knowledge I have learned and hone more practical skills. Using my knowledge of Python, SQL, R, Excel, and Power BI, I conducted several data analysis projects to demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data.
This is my repository to showcase skills, share project  and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics
